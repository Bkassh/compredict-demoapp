# compredict-demoapp

Thank you for providing me the opportunity to work on the Task and I have gained a lot of knowledge that has ultimately helped me in delivering the Task.

This is the Git repository with which the Demo AKS Cluster is bootstrapped by Flux. It has the simple nginx app deployment manifest files stored in a structured directory format.

Flux CD manages the deployment in the AKS cluster with changes made in the manifests available in the path "./app".

I am new to writing README files, I have double checked for error while writing but if something pops up, then kindly excuse.
Looking forward for more.
